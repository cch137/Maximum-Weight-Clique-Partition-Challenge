# Analysis of the Maximum-Weight Clique Partition Problem

## Problem with Sample Input

The sample input represents this graph:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Edges: (0,1)=3, (0,2)=5, (0,4)=1, (1,2)=4, (1,4)=5, (2,4)=6, (3,4)=7

### Key Observation

Node 4 is connected to ALL other nodes (0, 1, 2, 3), but the other nodes don't form a complete graph:

- Nodes 0, 1, 2 are all connected to each other âœ“
- Node 3 is only connected to node 4
- There's no edge between node 3 and nodes 0, 1, 2

### The Fundamental Issue

For the constraint "every edge must be part of at least one clique" to be satisfied, we need:

1. Edge (3,4) must be in some clique containing both 3 and 4
2. Edges (0,4), (1,4), (2,4) must be in cliques containing 4 and the respective other nodes

But this creates a conflict:

- If 4 is in a clique with 3, then to cover edges (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), we'd need 0, 1, 2 to also be in that clique
- But then we'd need edges (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) to exist, which they don't

### Conclusion

This particular graph CANNOT be partitioned into cliques while satisfying the edge coverage constraint. The problem instance may be:

1. Invalid/unsolvable, or
2. Expecting a relaxed interpretation of the constraints

## Possible Solutions

### Option 1: Relaxed Edge Coverage

Allow some edges to remain uncovered and minimize the number of uncovered edges.

### Option 2: Best Effort Partition

Find the partition that covers the maximum number of edges while satisfying other constraints.

### Option 3: Alternative Interpretation

The sample output "1 2 4" might suggest a different interpretation where we only need to output one clique that covers some subset of edges.

## Recommended Approach

Given the theoretical analysis, I'll implement a best-effort algorithm that:

1. Tries to cover as many edges as possible
2. Prioritizes larger cliques and higher-weight edges
3. Reports which edges cannot be covered due to graph structure constraints
