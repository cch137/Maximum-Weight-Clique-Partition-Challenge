# Key Points

- Research suggests the problem involves partitioning a graph into disjoint cliques with size constraints, maximizing edge weight averages, but the objective value seems constant for valid partitions.
- It seems likely that the task is to find any valid partition where each clique has at most \( k \) nodes and every edge is within a clique, given the graph's structure.
- The evidence leans toward using a greedy approach to iteratively build cliques, ensuring all edges are covered, though feasibility depends on graph connectivity and \( k \).

# Problem Understanding

The Maximum-Weight Clique Partition Challenge requires partitioning an undirected graph
\( G = (V, E) \) with \( n \) nodes into disjoint cliques, each with at most \( k \) nodes, such that every pair in a clique is connected by an edge, no node is isolated, every edge is part of at least one clique, and the average value of edge weights within cliques is maximized. The final value is calculated as the total sum of edge weights within cliques divided by the total number of nodes \( n \).

# Analysis and Approach

Initial analysis suggests that for any valid partition meeting all conditions, the objective value (average edge weight) is constant, as it equals the sum of all edge weights divided by \( n \). This implies the task is to find any valid partition, not necessarily optimize a variable objective. The key challenge is ensuring every edge is within at least one clique, which means for every edge \( (u, v) \), \( u \) and \( v \) must be in the same clique, requiring the partition to respect graph connectivity without edges between different cliques.

Given this, a greedy approach is proposed: iteratively build cliques of size up to \( k \) by starting with high-degree unassigned nodes and adding compatible neighbors, ensuring each clique is a complete subgraph. This process repeats until all nodes are assigned, aiming to cover all edges within the cliques formed.

# Implementation Considerations

The implementation involves parsing the weight matrix, where \(-9999\) indicates no edge, and using dynamic memory allocation in C to manage the partition. The approach ensures cliques are disjoint and of size at most \( k \), but feasibility depends on whether the graph can be partitioned such that no edges exist between different cliques, effectively requiring the graph to be a cluster graph (disjoint union of cliques) for certain \( k \).

# Survey Note: Detailed Investigation of the Maximum-Weight Clique Partition Challenge

## Introduction

This report conducts an in-depth investigation into the Maximum-Weight Clique Partition Challenge, aiming to develop an optimal algorithmic solution at a PhD-level of expertise. The problem involves partitioning an undirected graph \( G = (V, E) \) with \( n \) nodes into disjoint cliques, each with at most \( k \) nodes, ensuring every pair in a clique is connected, no node is isolated, every edge is part of at least one clique, and maximizing the average value of edge weights within cliques. The final value is given by:

\[
\text{Weight} = \frac{\sum*{i=1}^M \sum*{(u, v) \in C*i} w(u, v)}{\sum*{i=1}^M |C_i|}
\]

where \( M \) is the number of cliques, \( C*i \) is the \( i \)-th clique, \( (u, v) \in C_i \) denotes pairs within \( C_i \) connected by an edge, \( w(u, v) \) is the edge weight, and \( |C_i| \) is the size of \( C_i \), with \( \sum*{i=1}^M |C_i| = n \).

## Problem Analysis

The input is provided in upper-triangular format, with edge weights given for \( i < j \), and \(-9999\) indicating no edge. The graph is symmetric, and the output is a 2D array representing the partition into cliques. The sample input for \( n=5 \) and corresponding output "1 2 4" suggest a partition, but detailed analysis is needed to ensure all conditions are met.

## Initial Interpretation

The conditions imply:

- Each clique \( C_i \) must be a complete subgraph (clique) in \( G \).
- The cliques are disjoint and cover all nodes (\( V = \cup C_i \), \( C_i \cap C_j = \emptyset \) for \( i \neq j \)).
- Every edge \( (u, v) \in E \) must be within at least one clique, meaning there exists \( C_i \) such that \( u, v \in C_i \).
- Each clique size is \( 1 \leq |C_i| \leq k \).
- The objective is to maximize the average, which, given the formula, is:

\[
\frac{\text{total sum of edge weights within cliques}}{n}
\]

Initially, it was hypothesized that the total sum is fixed at \( \sum\_{(u,v) \in E} w(u,v) \) for valid partitions, as each edge must be within exactly one clique due to disjointness, making the objective constant. This led to the conclusion that the task is to find any valid partition, not optimize a variable.

## Detailed Reasoning

Consider the condition "every input edge must be part of at least one clique." For disjoint cliques, an edge \( (u, v) \) is part of a clique \( C_i \) only if both \( u, v \in C_i \). Since cliques are disjoint, \( u \) and \( v \) must be in the same clique for \( (u, v) \) to be covered. This implies that the partition must be such that no edges exist between different cliques; otherwise, those edges would not be covered, violating the condition. Thus, the graph must be partitionable into disjoint cliques with no inter-cluster edges, effectively requiring \( G \) to be a cluster graph (disjoint union of cliques) for certain \( k \).

However, analysis of the sample input (e.g., \( n=5 \), edges like \( (0,1)=3 \), \( (0,4)=1 \), \( (3,4)=7 \)) shows connectivity (e.g., node 3 connected to 4, 4 connected to 0,1,2), suggesting it's not a cluster graph. For instance, trying to partition into \(\{0,1,2,4\}\) and \(\{3\}\) fails, as edge \( (3,4) \) is not covered (3 in \(\{3\}\), 4 in \(\{0,1,2,4\}\)). This raises questions about the feasibility for general graphs, especially with \( k \) constraints.

## Objective Value Analysis

Given the formula, if all edges are covered, the numerator

\[
\sum*{i=1}^M \sum*{(u,v) \in C_i} w(u,v)
\]

should equal

\[
\sum\_{(u,v) \in E} w(u,v)
\]

as each edge is in exactly one clique. The denominator is \( n \), so the objective is constant for valid partitions. This contradicts the optimization nature, suggesting either a misinterpretation or that the problem assumes graphs where such partitions exist, and the task is to find any valid one.

## Literature Review

Research on related problems, such as the **maximum edge clique partitioning problem**, shows it's NP-hard for graphs with clique number \( \geq 3 \), focusing on maximizing edges within cliques without size constraints. Our problem adds a size constraint \( k \) and requires all edges to be covered, aligning more with partitioning into cliques ensuring connectivity, but standard results suggest complexity for general graphs.

## Algorithmic Solution

Given the analysis, we propose a greedy approach, assuming the graph allows a valid partition:

### Graph Parsing

Use the weight matrix, where \( \text{weights}[i][j] = -9999 \) indicates no edge.

### Greedy Clique Construction

Iteratively:

1. Select an unassigned node \( u \) with the highest degree among unassigned nodes.
2. Start a clique with \( u \), then add up to \( k-1 \) unassigned neighbors that form a clique (connected to all current clique nodes).
3. Use intersection of neighbor lists to ensure completeness.
4. Add the clique to the partition, mark nodes as assigned.
5. Repeat until all nodes are assigned.

This ensures each clique is of size \( \leq k \) and a complete subgraph, but coverage of all edges depends on the graph's structure. For connected components not being cliques, partitioning may fail if \( k \) is too small (e.g., path of 3 nodes, \( k=2 \)), suggesting the problem assumes feasible inputs.

## Implementation Details

The C implementation involves dynamic memory allocation for cliques, using arrays to track assigned nodes and build candidates. Efficiency is managed by selecting high-degree nodes, with complexity \( O(n^2) \) per clique build for small \( n \), suitable for the problem's likely constraints.

## Example and Validation

For the sample input (\( n=5 \), edges like \( (0,1)=3 \), output "1 2 4"), analysis shows challenges in covering all edges (e.g., \( (3,4) \)), suggesting the sample may imply \( k \geq 4 \) and specific partitions. The greedy approach may yield \(\{0,1,2,4\}\) (if a clique, \( k \geq 4 \)) and \(\{3\}\), but edge coverage needs verification, highlighting potential input assumptions.

# Conclusion

The problem's objective appears constant for valid partitions, reducing to finding any partition into disjoint cliques of size \( \leq k \) covering all edges, requiring the graph to be partitionable without inter-cluster edges. The proposed greedy algorithm is practical for small \( n \), with feasibility depending on graph structure and \( k \). Further research into exact conditions for solvability is recommended, given potential NP-hardness for general cases.
