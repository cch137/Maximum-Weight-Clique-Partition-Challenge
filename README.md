# Maximum-Weight Clique Partition Challenge - PhD-Level Solution

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive PhD-level investigation and implementation of the Maximum-Weight Clique Partition Challenge, a complex NP-hard optimization problem in combinatorial graph theory.

## Problem Statement

Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) with weighted edges, partition the vertices into disjoint cliques such that:

1. **Clique Property**: Each partition forms a complete subgraph
2. **Disjoint Coverage**: Each node belongs to exactly one clique
3. **Edge Coverage**: Every input edge must be part of at least one clique
4. **Size Constraint**: Each clique has at most k nodes
5. **Objective**: Maximize the average weight of edges within cliques

The objective function is:

```
Weight = (Sum of all edge weights within cliques) / (Total number of nodes)
```

### Pseudocode

```
1. Sort nodes by degree (descending)
2. For each unassigned node:
   a. Create new clique with this node
   b. Greedily add compatible neighbors
   c. Prioritize nodes that cover uncovered edges
   d. Respect size constraint k
3. Post-process to improve edge coverage
4. Validate and return partition
